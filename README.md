# Koiny
A one-one-one transliteration of Hellenistic Greek to the Latin alphabet

Koiny is an alternative way to transliterate [Hellenistic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek) (also known as Koinè Greek) to the Latin alphabet. It adopts some principles from the traditional transliteration of Koine Greek, but uses all letters in the Latin alphabet to have a one-on-one representation from Greek to Latin letters.
